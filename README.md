# SecurePass API

SecurePass API offers a comprehensive solution for assessing password strength and ensuring that passwords adhere to best practices for security. It's designed to prevent common and sophisticated attack vectors by analyzing passwords for complexity, length, and the use of personal information.

## Features

- **Complexity Checks**: Validates passwords for a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- **Length Verification**: Ensures that passwords meet a minimum and maximum length requirement.
- **Personal Information Filter**: Checks passwords against user-provided personal information (e.g., name, date of birth, email) to avoid easily guessable passwords.
- **Common Words and Edit Distance**: Evaluates passwords against common words and their variations to prevent dictionary attacks.
- **API Integration**: Easy to integrate with existing web, mobile, and enterprise applications.
- **User Feedback**: Provides detailed feedback on password weaknesses and suggestions for improvement.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of REST APIs and how to make HTTP requests.

### Installation

Clone this repository or download the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/galisaishankar08/SecurePass.git
cd SecurePass
```

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Server

Start the SecurePass API server:

```
python app.py
```

The server will start, and the API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

### Checking Password Strength

To check the strength of a password, send a POST request to `/check_password` with a JSON payload containing the password and any personal information to be considered in the evaluation.

#### Request Example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/check_password \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "password": "ExamplePassword123!",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "dob": "1980-01-01",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}'
```

#### Response Example

```json
{
  "isSecure": true,
  "message": "Password is secure."
}
```

### Feedback and Suggestions

The API also provides feedback on why a password may be considered weak and suggestions for improvement:

```json
{
  "isSecure": false,
  "message": "Password should include both uppercase and lowercase letters and be at least 8 characters long."
}
```
